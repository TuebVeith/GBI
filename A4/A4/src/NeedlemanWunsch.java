     Add the implementation of your adapted Needleman-Wunsch aligner here. It should be capable of:
     - Using a constant linear gap penalty for alignment.
     - Utilize a stored scoring matrix to evaluate the alignment of characters.
     - Respect already existing gaps in two sequences to be aligned. The alignment of two gap characters should be scored with 0.
